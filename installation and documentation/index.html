		<h2 id="s2"><strong>2. Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h2>
		
	  <h3 id="s2-1"><strong>2.1. Requirements</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	  <p>LMCS requires the following software in order to run:
	  <ul>
			<li>PHP version 5.2 and above</li>
			<li>MySQL version 5 and above</li>
	  </ul>
		</p>
		
	  <hr>
		
	  <h3 id="s2-2"><strong>2.2. Installation Process</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p><strong>Uploading Script Files:</strong><br>
		The folder structure of the "LMCS" folder is as follows:<br>
		<img src="assets/images/p1.png" alt="Folder Structure" />
		<br>
		Upload all files within the script folder to your web server using an FTP software like <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>.<br>
It is not necessary to upload script files to the root folder.<br>
The script can also be accessed from a subfolder like "http://www.sitename.com/lmcs/".<br>

		  <br><strong>Setting up the Database:</strong><br>
First create new database in your MySQL server. (You can give it the name "soccer").<br>
Note: If you are on shared host, generally you create database using hosting provider's admin panel.<br>
If you have create database rights, you can also use phpMyAdmin.<br><br>
Once you have created database, you are ready to create tables.<br>
To create tables, please find "database.txt" file within "installation and documentation" folder.<br>
<img src="assets/images/p2.png" alt="database.txt" /><br>
Copy all its contents and execute it using phpMyAdmin panel.<br>
After the execution, table list should like the following: (for the version 1.0.0)
<img src="assets/images/p3.png" alt="Table list" /><br><br>

If you want to import demo data, please find "demo-content.txt" file within "installation and documentation" folder.<br>
<img src="assets/images/p28.png" alt="demo-content.txt" /><br>
Copy all its contents and execute it using phpMyAdmin panel.<br>

		  <br><strong>Setting up Configuration:</strong><br>
After you create database and create database tables, you need to configure your database access settings.<br>
Open "config/database.php" from "script" folder.<br>
Its contents should look like the following:<br>
<img src="assets/images/p4.png" alt="config/database.php" /><br>
Change the values according to your settings.<br>
<strong>$conn_host:</strong> database host url (generally "localhost")<br>
<strong>$conn_database:</strong> database name (if you followed this documentation, will be "soccer")<br>
<strong>$conn_user:</strong> database user name<br>
<strong>$conn_password:</strong> database user password<br>
Once you entered your settings, upload this file to your server. (change it with "your_script_folder/config/database.php")<br>

		  <br><strong>Setting up File Modes:</strong><br>
In order to the script run without errors, you should give write permissions to the following files and folders:<br>
- "admin/access_credentials.php"<br>
- "img/logo"<br>
Just set file mode to "0755" using ftp software or using control panel of your hosting provider.<br>
If you want, you can just execute "set_file_modes.php" located in the "script" folder you uploaded.<br>
<img src="assets/images/p27.png" alt="set_file_modes.php" /><br>
Once you have correct settings, you can delete this file from your web server.<br><br>

&rArr; <strong>Optional Step:</strong><br>
Open "config/site.php" from "script" folder.<br>
Its contents should look like the following:<br>
<img src="assets/images/p5.png" alt="config/site.php" width="775" /><br>
If you want to the errors to be displayed, change the value of the "$display_errors" variable to "true". (Please leave it to "false" on production.)<br>
Change the value of the "$time_zone" variable to one of the supported values. (<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php" target="_blank">Supported Time Zones</a>)<br>
Once you entered your settings, upload this file to your server. (change it with "your_script_folder/config/site.php")<br>
<strong>To change the language, set the value of "$language" variable to one of the supported languages. If the language doesn't exist, you can create one by cloning "english.php" file within "lang" folder.</strong><br>
<strong>If you want to use script to commentate rugby matches, please set the value of the variable "$script_match_type&quot; to &quot;rugby&quot;.</strong><br>
